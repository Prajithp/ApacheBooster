ApacheBooster
=============

ApacheBooster is a integration of nginx and varnish, this Plugin will reduce the server load spike and memory usage. Also the plugin will provide the maximum performance of your websites.

Varnish

Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 – 1000x, depending on your architecture. A high level overview of what Varnish does can be seen in the video attached to this web. Varnish performs really, really well. It is usually bound by the speed of the network, effectivly turning performance into a non-issue. We’ve seen Varnish delivering 20 Gbps on regular off-the-shelf hardware.

Nginx

Nginx is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

Unlike traditional servers, Nginx doesn’t rely on threads to handle requests. Instead it uses a much more scalable event-driven (asynchronous) architecture. This architecture uses small, but more importantly, predictable amounts of memory under load.
